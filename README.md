# Motion Alert  
The purpose of this project is to detect motion on the balcony and send me text message whenever it happens.  
I'm kicking this project off with starter code from Adrian Rosebrock's awesome books on [Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/raspberry-pi-for-computer-vision/).
